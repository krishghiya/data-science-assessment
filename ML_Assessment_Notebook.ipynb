The organization is working on a project to monitor and protect natural habitats using satellite data, wildlife sensor data, and geospatial information. Your task is to design and implement a data pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes this data to help identify areas needing immediate conservation attention as well as build a model that provides helpful insights related our organization's interests."

Think about how you might transform and store the data efficiently for querying and analysis and feed it into your model. \n",

NoSQL is better for storing JSON as we do not need a predefined schema like in Postgres and can index keys, though to be fair SQL and NoSQL have reached feature parity in most scenarios in this day and age (https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-019-0262-8). However, DocumentDB does not offer nearly as many advanced features as MongoDB, particularly when querying geospatial data, so we must consider whether we will need that functionality down the road."

    "- Slight negative correlation with total time outside protected areas:\n",
    "Animals that travel more distances seem to spend slightly less time outside protected areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Being classified as megafauna does not significantly affect the time spent outside protected areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Insights\n",
    "- <b>Conservation Efforts</b>:\n",
    "Given that more endangered species travel less and spend less time outside protected areas, conservation efforts might need to focus more on creating better habitats within protected areas to minimize their need to move outside for resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Movement Patterns</b>:\n",
    "The fact that megafauna travel slightly less distance suggests that these large animals might have larger home ranges or require specific habitats that limit their movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Policy Making</b>:\n",
    "By understanding these correlations, policymakers can better design protected areas considering the movement patterns of endangered species and megafauna, potentially reducing human-wildlife conflict and increasing habitat safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Further Research</b>:\n",
    "The weak correlations suggest that there may be other factors influencing these behaviors that should be investigated further. For instance, factors like availability of food sources, seasonal migrations, and human disturbances could provide additional insights.\n",

    "   - **Approach options:**\n",
    "     - **Cluster Analysis (start simple):** Use clustering techniques (e.g., DBSCAN) to identify high-risk zones based on historical movement patterns.\n",
    "     - **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection models to spot unusual movements that could signify risk.\n",
    "     - **Geospatial Analysis:** Combine animal movement data with environmental factors (e.g., weather, terrain) to predict risk zones using geospatial analytics."
